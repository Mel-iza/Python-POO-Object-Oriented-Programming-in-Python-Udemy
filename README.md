Udemy Course about [Object Oriented Programming in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/object-oriented-python-programming/learn/lecture/18241898#overview)

---

Programming Paradigm - An approach to organizer and structure your code

- <b>Procedural Programming:</b> A step by step procedure is followed sequentially to solve a problem
- <b>Object Oriented Programing (OOP):</b> real world entities or concepts are modelled using objects. An object has both state and behavior, means it contains both data and code to manipulate that data


Main components in object oriented programming:
> Classes is a blueprint to creating a object. A class actually specifies what data its objects will have and what behavior they exhibit. 
> Objects instance of an object using a class as the blueprint

state -> variables <br>
behavior -> methods <br>
advantage -> code reusability <br>
<br>

Important concepts: <br>
- Encapsulation <br>
- Inheritance <br>
- Abstraction <br>
- Polymorphism <br>
