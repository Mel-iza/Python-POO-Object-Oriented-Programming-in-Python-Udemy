Programming Paradigm - An approach to organizer and structure your code

- <b>Procedural Programming:</b> A step by step procedure is followed sequentially to solve a problem
- <b>Object Oriented Programing (OOP):</b> real world entities or concepts are modelled using objects. An object has both state and behavior, means it contains both data and code to manipulate that data
<br>

Main components in object oriented programming:
> Classes is a blueprint to creating a object. A class actually specifies what data its objects will have and what behavior they exhibit. 
> Objects instance of an object using a class as the blueprint

state -> variables <br>
behavior -> methods <br>
advantage -> code reusability <br>

<b>Important concepts: </b><br>
- Encapsulation <br>
- Inheritance <br>
- Abstraction <br>
- Polymorphism <br>
